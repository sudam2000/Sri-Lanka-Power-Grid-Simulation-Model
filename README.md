# Sri Lanka Power Grid Simulation Model 

An agent-based model simulating Sri Lanka's electrical power grid system with integrated renewable energy sources and battery energy storage systems (BESS).

## Overview

This NetLogo model provides a comprehensive simulation of Sri Lanka's power generation, transmission, and consumption network. The model focuses on the challenges and opportunities of integrating renewable energy sources (solar, wind, hydro) with battery storage systems while maintaining grid stability and economic viability.

## Key Features

- **Real-world Geographic Integration**: Uses actual Sri Lankan GIS data for provinces and districts
- **Comprehensive Energy Sources**: Solar, wind, hydro, thermal (coal/diesel), and biomass power plants
- **Advanced Battery Management**: Smart charging/discharging algorithms with efficiency modeling
- **Dynamic Weather System**: Realistic weather patterns affecting renewable generation
- **Economic Modeling**: Market dynamics, fuel prices, carbon taxation, and renewable subsidies
- **Multi-agent System**: Suppliers, distributors, and consumers with realistic behaviors
- **Grid Stability Analysis**: Real-time calculation of supply-demand balance and system reliability

## System Requirements

## Usage

### Basic Operation

1. **Setup**: Click "Setup" to initialize all agents and load GIS data
2. **Run**: Click "Go" to start continuous simulation or "Step" for single-step execution
3. **Monitor**: Observe real-time plots and system metrics

### Controls

#### Weather Parameters
- `solar-irradiance` (0-1): Solar generation potential
- `wind-speed` (0-1): Wind generation potential  
- `rainfall-level` (0-1): Hydro generation capacity
- `weather-volatility` (0-1): Weather change randomness
- `temperature` (20-40Â°C): Ambient temperature

#### Market Parameters
- `fuel-price-index` (0.5-3): Thermal generation cost multiplier
- `carbon-tax-rate` (0-20,000 Rs/ton): Environmental cost for thermal plants
- `renewable-subsidy` (0-5,000 Rs/MWh): Government incentive for renewables

#### System Controls
- `auto-weather?`: Enable automatic weather pattern changes
- `pause-simulation?`: Stop/resume simulation
- `show-consumer-satisfaction`: Display consumer metrics

### Emergency Scenarios

The model includes several emergency scenario buttons:
- `emergency-demand-increase`: Increase system demand by 20%
- `emergency-demand-decrease`: Decrease system demand by 20%
- Weather presets: `set-sunny-weather`, `set-windy-weather`, `set-rainy-weather`, `set-cloudy-weather`

## Key Metrics Monitored

- **System Generation**: Total MW output by source type
- **Renewable Percentage**: Share of clean energy in generation mix
- **Grid Stability**: System reliability index (0-1)
- **Battery Utilization**: Storage system usage percentage
- **Average Price**: System-wide electricity pricing (Rs/MWh)
- **Supply-Demand Balance**: Generation adequacy ratio
- **Blackout Risk**: Regional power shortage probability

## Battery Management System

The model features an advanced battery management system:

### Charging Logic
- Batteries charge during excess renewable generation
- Charging rate limited by technical specifications
- Storage efficiency losses modeled (87-92%)

### Discharging Logic
- Automatic discharge during supply deficits
- Grid support during peak demand periods
- Discharge efficiency and cycle counting

### Visual Indicators
- **Green**: Battery charging
- **Orange**: Battery discharging  
- **Red**: Low battery state (<20%)
- **Lime**: Full battery state (>80%)

## Research Applications

This model is suitable for analyzing:

- **Renewable Energy Integration**: Impact of increasing renewable share on grid stability
- **Battery Storage Optimization**: Sizing and operation strategies for BESS
- **Policy Analysis**: Effects of subsidies, carbon pricing, and regulations
- **Climate Resilience**: Grid response to extreme weather events
- **Economic Planning**: Cost-benefit analysis of different energy scenarios

## Model Validation

The model incorporates real-world data:
